Start with installing python 3.9 or newer.
then do pip install django
Pip install djangorestframework
pip install mysqlclient

start out with going into a terminal and navigate to VesuviusAPI.
In VesuviusAPI navigate still in the terminal to apiVesuvius.
Now open Xammp and create a database with the name vesuvius_rest_api.
then stil in terminal that should look like this \GitHub\VesuviusAPI\apiVesuvius> run the following command: python manage.py makemigrations
afterwards run the command: python manage.py migrate.
the next command afterwards should be: python manage.py createsuperuser.
fill out the information and remember it.
then do: python manage.py runserver.
you now have a running api.

you can find all paths to use in the api folder urls file.
the paths you are gonna be using will look something along the lines of http://127.0.0.1:8000/location-list/
if you want to input data in a easy way you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and enter the information of the superuser you created earlier.
