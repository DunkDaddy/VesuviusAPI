Start with installing python 3.9 or newer from https://www.python.org/.
once you have opened the python installer look at the buttom of the installation window and click the add to path option.
when python has been installed (you might need to restart) open up your terminal.
then do pip install django
Pip install djangorestframework
pip install mysqlclient

start out with going into a terminal and navigate to VesuviusAPI.
In VesuviusAPI navigate still in the terminal to apiVesuvius.
Now open Xammp and create a database with the name vesuvius_rest_api.
then stil in terminal that should look like this \GitHub\VesuviusAPI\apiVesuvius> run the following command: python manage.py makemigrations
afterwards run the command: python manage.py migrate.
the next command afterwards should be: python manage.py createsuperuser.
fill out the information and remember it.
then do: python manage.py runserver.
you now have a running api.
To stop the api you can go to the terminal it is in and press ctrl + c

you can find all paths to use in the folder 'api' and the urls file.
the paths you are gonna be using will look something along the lines of http://127.0.0.1:8000/location-list/
if you want to input data in a easy way you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and enter the information of the superuser you created earlier.
